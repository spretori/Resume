<hr>

       <p>I am a creative at heart, looking to enter the digital industry with an energetic and exciting ‘work-family’ who are able to help me grow!</p> 
        
        <p>My professional background is in project management and marketing, however, my passion is in website and digital design. After undertaking a front-end web development course, I knew the digital industry was the right fit for me. I accepted a website content management position with TEDxPerth and also started my own WordPress website design business as a passion-project – to help small businesses, community groups and not-for-profit organisations.
            I have enjoyed my freelance experience but at my core I am a people-person and work best in a team.   
            </p>
    
        
        <p>I have extensive experience managing both small- and large-scale projects – most notably the development of an online delivery platform for a local engineering college, as well as the launch of a new college Campus here in Perth.  The core success of these projects was my ability to function within and manage a team. I pride myself on my people and communication skills (and appreciate good humour to relieve tension).
 
            </p>
        <p>Combining my career, a nomadic childhood travelling the world and being a parent means that  I can cook spaghetti bolognese, prepare an invoice and mediate disputes while simultaneously constructing suspension bridges with play-dough. It also means I am able to communicate effectively with anyone from Middle Eastern dignitaries to toddlers without skipping a beat.</p>
        
        <p> I admit - I can’t do the latte art just yet - however I have found a tutorial and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyLPVfWtrBo.">I’m on it!</a></p>
        <p>
            I am shortly due to complete a full-time, Full Stack web development course which has given me more technical and back-end programming knowledge. I am now ready for a role in a dynamic and energetic digital organisation where I can soak up as much knowledge as possible, put my skills to the test and help your company grow.
